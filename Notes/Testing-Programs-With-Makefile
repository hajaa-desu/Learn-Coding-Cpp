* see ../Tests/mkdirDemo folder for working example

1) Generate test cases

	e.g. for areDistinct

	> len is zero or not?
	> arr either contains distinct elements or not

	Therefore, the test cases are:

	1. an empty file making len zero
	2. a file with distinct numbers
	3. a file with duplicate numbers

2) What are we trying to test? 

	areDistinct checks if the numbers in a file are distinct

	How?

	We can use sort and uniq in linux. sort orders number, uniq -d will print duplicate numbers in a file 

	sort filename | uniq -d 

3) Redirecting output
	
	$ ./prog inputs/input0 > outputs/output0
